# Enchan Theory Verification Package (v0.3.0)

This package verifies that the acceleration scaling law ("Quadrature Closure") theoretically derived in **Enchan Theory v0.3.0 (Inception/Defect Model)** is consistent with actual galactic observational data (SPARC).

## Theoretical Background (v0.3.0 Pivot)

In Enchan Theory v0.3.0, spacetime is modeled as a structure containing "topological defects" (wrinkles in the time-dilation field $S$).
The theoretical predictions derived from its Lagrangian are as follows:

1.  **Geometric Dark Matter:** The energy density of the defect scales as $\rho \sim 1/r^2$, generating flat rotation curves.
2.  **Acceleration Scale $a_0$:** It is a derived parameter determined by the vacuum stiffness $\sigma_{vac}$ and the strength of the defect, rather than a fundamental constant.
3.  **Effective Acceleration Law:** The total acceleration $g_{tot}$ follows the "Quadrature Closure" due to the interaction between baryonic gravity $g_{bar}$ and the defect:
    $$g_{tot} = \sqrt{g_{bar}^2 + a_0 g_{bar}}$$

The scripts included in this package quantitatively demonstrate that prediction **"3. Effective Acceleration Law"** holds with high precision in the actual universe.

## Included Files

* `enchan_core_model.py`: Core definition of the theoretical model (Quadrature Closure).
* `enchan_btfr_reproduce_enchan.py`: Verifies the universality of $a_0$ using BTFR data.
* `enchan_rar_reproduce_enchan.py`: Verifies the goodness-of-fit of the theoretical curve in the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR).
* `enchan_rotationcurve_reproduce_enchan.py`: Predicts and verifies rotation curves for individual galaxies.

## Input Data (Prepared Separately)

Please ensure the following SPARC data files are present in the root directory (do not commit them to Git):

* `Rotmod_LTG.zip` (SPARC mass models)
* `BTFR_Lelli2019.mrt` (SPARC BTFR table)

## Usage

1.  **Determine $a_0$:**
    Back-calculate the observed value of the theoretical parameter $a_0$ from the BTFR data.
    ```bash
    python enchan_btfr_reproduce_enchan.py --mrt BTFR_Lelli2019.mrt
    ```
    (Example output: median $a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$)

2.  **Verify Theory:**
    Using the identified $a_0$, test the reproducibility of the RAR and rotation curves.
    ```bash
    python enchan_rar_reproduce_enchan.py --zip Rotmod_LTG.zip --a0 1.2e-10
    python enchan_rotationcurve_reproduce_enchan.py --zip Rotmod_LTG.zip --a0 1.2e-10
    ```

## Conclusion

The verification results generated by these scripts provide observational evidence supporting the **"Derivation of $a_0$"** presented in Enchan Field Notes v0.3.0.
