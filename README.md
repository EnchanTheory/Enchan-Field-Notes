# Enchan Field Notes (Theoretical Framework)

**Current Version:** v0.2.2
**Status:** Speculative / Work in Progress

## 🚀 What's New in v0.2.2
This release incorporates major theoretical updates and structural refinements:
* **Added Chapter 3 (Physical Motivation):** Explicitly connected the Enchan axiomatic structure to General Relativity using **Kerr black hole metrics**.
* **Rotational Stability Defined:** Mathematically demonstrated how the spin parameter ($a_*$) modifies the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO), providing a physical basis for the control parameter $\Omega$.
* **Clarified Interpretational Remarks:** Added distinct definitions for microscopic time ($t$) and emergent macroscopic time ($T$).
* **Updated Disclaimer:** Explicitly stated that technological implementations (devices/patents) are out of scope.

## Overview
Enchan Field Notes is a collection of theoretical memoranda exploring the concept of **Emergent Spacetime** and **Geometric Dark Matter**.
It proposes a speculative framework where spacetime geometry emerges from microscopic fluctuations and rotational control.

## Key Concepts
* **Emergent Gravity:** Gravity as a residual effect of spatial ordering.
* **Geometric Dark Matter:** Identifying dark matter with topological defects ($|\nabla S| \propto 1/r$).
* **Rotational Stability:** Utilizing Kerr metric analogies to describe stability control.

## Disclaimer
This repository contains purely theoretical and cosmological descriptions.
**Technological implementations, specific device architectures, and industrial applications (e.g., Enchan-001/002) are explicitly out of scope and are not disclosed here.**
