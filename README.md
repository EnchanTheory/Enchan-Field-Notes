# Enchan Field Notes (Theoretical Framework)

**Current Version:** v0.3.0
**Status:** Speculative / Theoretical Proposal (with Numerical Verification)

## 🚀 What's New in v0.3.0 (The Pivot)
This version marks a significant paradigm shift from the "Resonant Space" model (v0.2.x) to the **"Inception World / Topological Defect"** model. Following null results in macroscopic resonance searches, the framework has been re-derived from a new geometric basis:

* **Hypothesis Shift:** Gravity is redefined as "friction" against a cosmic fall within a higher-dimensional embedding ("Inception World"). The scalar field $S$ is now interpreted as a dimensionless **Time-Dilation factor**.
* **Derivation of $a_0$:** We successfully derive the critical acceleration scale $a_0$ from the Lagrangian of a logarithmic topological defect, identifying it as a composite parameter of vacuum stiffness and defect geometry.
* **The "Anchor" Condition:** Introduced the concept of baryonic mass acting as a "pinning center" for vacuum defects, naturally recovering the phenomenology of MOND without modifying inertia.
* **Numerical Verification Added:** Added a Python verification package (`enchan-theory-verification/`) that reproduces the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) and Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) using public SPARC galaxy data.

## Overview
Enchan Field Notes is a collection of theoretical memoranda exploring the concept of **Emergent Spacetime** and the **Dark Sector**.
It proposes that "Dark Matter" is not a particle species, but the elastic stress energy of topological defects ($\nabla S$) in the time-flow field, anchored by baryonic matter.

## Key Concepts (v0.3.0)
* **Inception World Hypothesis:** Our universe is embedded in a bulk flow; "time" is the velocity of the fall.
* **Geometric Dark Matter:** Dark halos are topological defects with a density profile $\rho \propto 1/r^2$ (Singular Isothermal Sphere), generating flat rotation curves.
* **The Anchor Condition:** Defects are stabilized by baryonic mass. This coupling imposes the relation $v^4 \propto M_b$.
* **Quadrature Closure:** The effective acceleration follows the emergent law $g_{tot} = \sqrt{g_{bar}^2 + a_0 g_{bar}}$.

## Repository Structure
