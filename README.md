# Enchan Field Notes (Theoretical Framework)

**Current Version:** v0.2.3
**Status:** Speculative / Work in Progress

## 🚀 What's New in v0.2.3
This update adds important observational context and bounds based on recent investigations:
* **Added Experimental Constraints (Chapter 6):** Included a summary of null results from feasibility studies and public LIGO/Virgo strain data analysis.
* **Parameter Space Bounded:** Explicitly ruled out the "human-scale strong-coupling" variant of the hypothesis within the tested frequency band (10–100 Hz).
* **Theoretical Clarification:** Added a remark distinguishing the hypothesized driven coupling from general relativistic black-hole ringdown (Quasi-Normal Modes).

*(Previous v0.2.2 updates included: Rotational Stability defined via Kerr metric analogies, and definitions for emergent macroscopic time.)*

## Overview
Enchan Field Notes is a collection of theoretical memoranda exploring the concept of **Emergent Spacetime** and **Geometric Dark Matter**.
It proposes a speculative framework where spacetime geometry emerges from microscopic fluctuations and rotational control.

## Key Concepts
* **Emergent Gravity:** Gravity as a residual effect of spatial ordering.
* **Geometric Dark Matter:** Identifying dark matter with topological defects ($|\nabla S| \propto 1/r$).
* **Rotational Stability:** Utilizing Kerr metric analogies to describe stability control.
* **Observational Constraints:** Bounding coupling constants using interferometric data limits.

This repository contains purely theoretical and cosmological descriptions.
**Technological implementations, specific device architectures, and industrial applications (e.g., feasibility studies referenced in the notes) are explicitly out of scope and are not disclosed here.**
